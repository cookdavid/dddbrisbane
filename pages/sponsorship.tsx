      {props.pageMetadata.conference.TagLine}. {props.pageMetadata.conference.Name} provides a unique opportunity to
      sponsors because we attract people that don't normally go to software conferences. This occurs as a natural result
      of our core principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Making the ticket price as low as possible ({props.pageMetadata.conference.TicketPrice}); people don't need to
        request PD budget from their employer to attend and it's accessible to most people regardless of financial
        circumstance
      </li>
      <li>
        Running the event on a Saturday; people don't have to arrange time off work and contractors don't have to miss
        out on billable opportunities
      </li>
      <li>
        Allowing anyone to submit about any software industry related topic; gathers wide interest from extended
        networks within the community
      </li>
      <li>Having a democratically chosen agenda; generates excitement and interest from the wider community</li>
      <li>
        Focussing on creating a safe and inclusive environment where everyone is welcome; encourages a diverse set of
        attendees and attracts repeat visitors and an expanding presence year on year via a growing network
      </li>
    </ul>

      {props.pageMetadata.conference.Name} is a not-for-profit community event with a low ticket price for attendees
      (much lower than the per-person cost) and the only way we can run it is via generous corporate sponsorship. Thanks
      to all our sponsors new and old - we can't do this without you!
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2017 DDD Perth had 330 attendees from 360 sold tickets; this makes us the biggest software conference in
      Western Australia.

      We have a sponsorship prospectus that will be provided on request that explains detailed benefits and impact of
      sponsorship and the difference between the various levels; if you would like a copy{' '}
